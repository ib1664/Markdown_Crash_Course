# Statement of Issues Response
### Ignatius Edista     
##### 30th August 2022
<br>

After a tour and inspection of the SDA High Physical Supports appartments at the *[Pavilions](https://www.housinghub.org.au/property-details/744, "Houing Hub, Pavilions")*, Sydney Olympic Park, with parents, OT and carers, I expressed my interest to live independently at the unit. After completing an application for tenancy and providing a character reference and letter of personal statement I was granted a Condional Offer from Summer Housing on 11th February 2021. I have provided the documention of this offer along with other documents that may be of interest about the apartment along with this responses.
<br>

> The cost for SDA at Sydney Olympic Park is set by the NDIA and can be calculated using the NDIA SDA Price Calculator that accompanies this response:
>
>> For the financial year of 2022, the cost works out to be $99,720.

**Information about the features of the building in relation to needs, including onsite assistance**

---

This is covered in both the Appeal letter that I provided and the OT supplementary report. In the OT supplementary report, it states the cost effectiveness in relation to the onsite assistance:
> “The proposed building type, single resident Apartment, will provide Ignatius with access to 24 hour support in a shared arrangement with nine other residents within the apartment complex. He will continue to require 1:1 support with self-care tasks and domestic tasks however incidental support can be provided through onsite support in a shared arrangement.”

This ensures that I will benefit from the 1:1 self-care that my usual carers can provide, however, I can still benefit from the 24 hour shared support provided by the apartment complex during an incident. The report goes on to further state how this arrangement will maintain my health into the future and how the current informal supports that my parents provide in not sustainable in the long term.

> While remaining in the family home where care is highly supplemented by his aging parents, his parents are at risk where formal supports are not present and the situation is not considered sustainable (refer to participant informal supports statement). The building type, Apartment, one resident is considered appropriate in reducing risk to Ignatius where support provided by his parents becomes immediately unsustainable (poor health or death of informal support) and risks to his parents as related to the provision of ongoing support.

**Specific design features of the apartment that will be of benefit**

---

The design features of the apartment features structured provisions to the ceiling which will provide me the the ability to use a ceiling hoist and enable a more safer, cost effective way of transfer than the mobile hoist. 

> The ability to install a ceiling hoist will ensure that those supporting him in a 1:1 arrangement have access to necessary equipment without the need to increase assistance with transfers to a 2:1 arrangement.

The advantage of having my own living space can also be summed up by the following which states:

> Access to his own living space will ensure he can continue with his studies and seek employment in the future, without disruption or distraction ... and not isolated within his bedroom, which would occur in a shared living arrangement.

More unique design features of the one residence apartment that is stated in the OT report is the benefit of having the extra room to myself, to place my workstation and freely work free from disturbance. Because I must remain in my power chair throughout the day, sufficient space to maneuver and store equipment is not possible if I was forced to do this in my bedroom. 

> A building type of House, 3 residents would not provide sufficient space for the necessary workstation set-up and associated computer access technology. The appropriate building type, Apartment, one resident will ensure Ignatius can complete his studies and move on to employment.

More design features which were provided to me from a consultant from the housing hub include:
* Liveable Housing Australia ‘Platinum’ level.
* External doors and external outdoor private areas to be accessible by wheelchair.
* Bathroom vanity/hand basin to be accessible in seated or standing position.
* Power supply to doors and windows (blinds), for retrofit of automation as necessary.
* Consideration must be given to whether it is appropriate for the kitchen sink, cooktop, meal preparation bench area and key appliances (dishwasher, oven, microwave oven and laundry appliances) to be accessible in seated or standing position.
* Structural provision for ceiling hoists.
* Assistive technology ready.
* Heating/cooling and household communication technology (e.g. video or intercom systems) appropriate for the needs of residents.
* Emergency power solutions to cater for a minimum two hour outage where the welfare of participant(s) is at risk.
* Doors with 950mm minimum clear opening width to all habitable rooms. 

**What other housing options (other than SDA) have been explored or considered and why these options are not suitable**

As stated earlier in this statement as well as other documents which include OT Report SDA, dated 18th March 2021, I currently reside with my parents in the family house. This is not sustainable as the OT Report states:

> Ignatius’s parents provide support beyond what is reasonably expected of a parent to a 44-year-old adult child. They provide this support without raising concern and have continued to provide this support into their 70’s. Maya and John Edista are ageing, it is essential that Ignatius is not placed in an emergency situation where his support needs cannot be supplemented by his parents due to their age, an age-related illness or injury.
It is considered reasonable that Ignatius transitions from the family home prior to his parents’ inability to supplement care or difficulties organising onsite care in the home with overnight support.

In the provided psychologist letter dated 20th August 2021, it also states that:

> I have been made aware that Mr Edista’s parents are aging, and approaching retirement age, being no longer physically able to attend to Mr Edista’s daily care need.

I have also previously pointed out experience in living in a group home shortly after leaving hospital. This is in my personal statements that I have submitted to the NDIA. The exert below taken from the statement says:

> I have experienced living in a shared accommodation setting. This was during the period during which I was transition from the hospital to my home. When I was awaiting the completion of home modifications. This period in my life was one of the most stressful and humiliating periods of my life. One I do not wish to revisit. ... Living in a 1 resident only apartment would give me the choice to live the life I want and the peace of mind to build my confidence and achieve my goals.

I have also considered privately renting an apartment. This solution is not viable since finding a suitable location that is accessible and has the right design modifications done is quite slim. I have contacted Housing Hub, Teigen Bywater regarding the option to personally rent one of these modified apartments. The cost was beyond my capacity to afford and that the only option was through an SDA.  

**How will living alone impact on his risk for social isolation?**

---

Living alone in a single residence gives me the freedom and control to choose when I want to socialise and when I choose to spend time alone relaxing. I’m not looking to socially isolate myself from the community. Merely the independence to decide who I want to associate with and when. As stated in the OT Supplementary report:

> Ignatius has clearly stated that he would like to establish friendships, the building type, Apartment, one bedroom will ensure that once those networks are established, he can spend time with his friends in his own living area, not shared with others.

As an employee at eHealth, I am privileged to work with a great team in which I correspond with frequently. As as student I regularly work amongst teams to complete assessments and projects. By having a single residence home that I can relax away from others will give me 

**Has the Applicant trialled living with other people before?**

---

I have already stated that I have experienced living with other people in my personal statement that I had originally submitted to NDIA as well as in the above answer to the statement of issues question on have I considered or explored other housing options other than SDA.

**Can the Applicant share with others were he able to utilise a private bathroom? Please provide reasons for your answer**

---

In my personal statement to be NDIA I had started:

> Having to again live in a shared housing environment with other disabled people is one I would simply refuse to take even if it was the only option. It would again just make me feel highly stressed and anxious about my safety as I would be at the mercy of the behaviour of other residence and their mental state. This will strongly impact my emotions and significantly hinder or even stop my ability to complete my academic studies and pursue a career.
