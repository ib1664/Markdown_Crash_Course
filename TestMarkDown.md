### The respondent invites the Applicant to confirm whether he has been offered a single occupant apartment by an SDA provider.
---

After a tour and inspection of the SDA High Physical Supports appartments at the *[Pavilions](https://www.housinghub.org.au/property-details/744, "Houing Hub, Pavilions")*, Sydney Olympic Park, with parents, OT and carers, I expressed my interest to live independently at the unit. After completing an application for tenancy and providing a character reference and letter of personal statement I was granted a Condional Offer from Summer Housing on 11th February 2021. I have provided the documention of this offer along with other documents that may be of interest about the apartment along with this responses.

### Information about the features of the building in relation to needs, including onsite assistance
---

This is covered in both the Appeal letter that I provided and the OT supplementary report. In the ___OT supplementary report dated 9 August pg 5___, it states the cost effectiveness in relation to the onsite assistance:

> The proposed building type, single resident Apartment, will provide Ignatius with access to 24 hour support in a shared arrangement with nine other residents within the apartment complex. He will continue to require 1:1 support with self-care tasks and domestic tasks however incidental support can be provided through onsite support in a shared arrangement. 

This ensures that I will benefit from the 1:1 self-care that my usual carers can provide, however, I can still benefit from the 24 hour shared support provided by the apartment complex during an incident. The  ___OT supplementary report dated 9 August pg 5___ further state how this arrangement will maintain my health into the future and how the current informal supports that my parents provide in not sustainable in the long term.

> While remaining in the family home where care is highly supplemented by his aging parents, his parents are at risk where formal supports are not present and the situation is not considered sustainable (refer to participant informal supports statement). The building type, Apartment, one resident is considered appropriate in reducing risk to Ignatius where support provided by his parents becomes immediately unsustainable (poor health or death of informal support) and risks to his parents as related to the provision of ongoing support.

### Specific design features of the apartment that will be of benefit
---

The design features of the apartment features structured provisions to the ceiling which will provide me the the ability to use a ceiling hoist and enable a more safer, cost effective way of transfer than the mobile hoist. The ___OT supplementary report dated 9 August pg 5___ states:

> The ability to install a ceiling hoist will ensure that those supporting him in a 1:1 arrangement have access to necessary equipment without the need to increase assistance with transfers to a 2:1 arrangement.

More design features which were provided to me from [@Teigen](mailto:teigen.bywater@housinghub.org.au) from the housing hub include:

* Liveable Housing Australia ‘Platinum’ level.
* External doors and external outdoor private areas to be accessible by wheelchair.
* Bathroom vanity/hand basin to be accessible in seated or standing position.
* Power supply to doors and windows (blinds), for retrofit of automation as necessary.
* Consideration must be given to whether it is appropriate for the kitchen sink, cooktop, meal preparation bench area and key appliances (dishwasher, oven, microwave oven and laundry appliances) to be accessible in seated or standing position.
* Structural provision for ceiling hoists.
* Assistive technology ready.
* Heating/cooling and household communication technology (e.g. video or intercom systems) appropriate for the needs of residents.
* Emergency power solutions to cater for a minimum two hour outage where the welfare of participant(s) is at risk.
* Doors with 950mm minimum clear opening width to all habitable rooms.

### What other housing options (other than SDA) have been explored or considered and why these options are not suitable
---

As stated earlier in this statement as well as the included ___OT Report SDA, dated 18th March 2021 pg 19___, I currently reside with my parents in the family house. This is not sustainable as the OT Report states:

> Ignatius’s parents provide support beyond what is reasonably expected of a parent to a 44-year-old adult child. They provide this support without raising concern and have continued to provide this support into their 70’s. Maya and John Edista are ageing, it is essential that Ignatius is not placed in an emergency situation where his support needs cannot be supplemented by his parents due to their age, an age-related illness or injury.
It is considered reasonable that Ignatius transitions from the family home prior to his parents’ inability to supplement care or difficulties organising onsite care in the home with overnight support.

In the provided The ___Psychologist Letter of Support SDA 20 Aug 2021___, it also states that:

> I have been made aware that Mr Edista’s parents are aging, and approaching retirement age, being no longer physically able to attend to Mr Edista’s daily care need.

I have also previously pointed out experience in living in a group home shortly after leaving hospital. This is in my ___Personal Statements dated 2 August 2021___ that I have submitted to the NDIA. The exert below taken from the statement says:

> I have experienced living in a shared accommodation setting. This was during the period during which I was transition from the hospital to my home. When I was awaiting the completion of home modifications. This period in my life was one of the most stressful and humiliating periods of my life. One I do not wish to revisit. ... Living in a 1 resident only apartment would give me the choice to live the life I want and the peace of mind to build my confidence and achieve my goals.

I have also considered privately renting an apartment. This solution is not viable since finding a suitable location that is accessible and has the right design modifications done is quite slim. I have contacted Housing Hub, Teigen Bywater regarding the option to personally rent one of these modified apartments. The cost was beyond my capacity to afford and that the only option was through an SDA.

### How will living alone impact on his risk for social isolation?
---

Living alone in a single residence gives me the freedom and control to choose when I want to socialise and when I choose to spend time alone relaxing. I’m not looking to socially isolate myself from the community. Merely the independence to decide who I want to associate with and when. As stated in the ___OT Supplementary report dated the 18th March 2021 pg 7___:

> Ignatius has clearly stated that he would like to establish friendships, the building type, Apartment, one bedroom will ensure that once those networks are established, he can spend time with his friends in his own living area, not shared with others.

As an employee at eHealth, I am privileged to work with a great team in which I correspond with frequently. As as student I regularly work amongst teams to complete assessments and projects. By having a single residence home that I can relax away from others will give me 

Further evidence regarding my ability to form relationships with others can further be shown from the ___OT SDA report dated on the 18th March 2021 pg 23___ and submitted to the NDIA during the initial application. The report further highlight the fact that I merely seek the ability to just have time to myself. 

> Ignatius is quiet and tends to spend long periods of time alone and it is not considered appropriate after many years that he is moved into a shared living arrangement. No concerns exist regarding Ignatius’s ability to develop and maintain relationships with others however it is not considered appropriate or reasonable that he does not have his own living space and autonomy within his home, that he has been accustom to over the years.

### Has the Applicant trialled living with other people before?

---

I have already stated that I have experienced living with other people in my personal statement that I had originally submitted to NDIA as well as in the above answer to the statement of issues question on have I considered or explored other housing options other than SDA. The ___Psychologist Letter of Support SDA 20 Aug 2021___ emphasizes my previous experience with living with other people and my unwillingness to do so again.

> As you are likely aware, prior to Mr Edista’s injury he was fully able, living life independently without any need for care. Following this, he experienced a short period of time in which he lived within a group home whilst he waited for home modifications to be completed. This experience has been described by Mr Edista as being traumatising. ... His experience with those with diverse needs, highlighted to him that he is not able to form bonds of friendship, kinship, or a sense of shared experience in such a setting. He recalls withdrawing from all members of the care team, and only engage in support when it was vital. When asked about this time, he reported that his quality of life was at the lowest he could recall.

The ___Housing Hub - Appeal letter dated 27 May 2022 pg 4___ which was provided to me and which I have also provided, quotes a report from the Summer Foundation Report titled ‘Support in SDA Apartments’ (March 2022) regarding the reality of shared SDA arrangements such as multi residential houses. It states:

> *“people with disability are often segregated and live according to rigid staff routines, rosters and work priorities. In turn, this negatively impacts the choice and control of their housing and support, as well as their community participation. Although group homes in Australia vary in their age and configurations, residents generally have limited – if any – say about who they live with”*. Living in a house with two other people that he did not choose will have a negative impact on Ignatius’

### Can the Applicant share with others were he able to utilise a private bathroom? Please provide reasons for your answer
---

In my ___Personal Statements dated 2nd August 2021___ to be NDIA I had started:

> Having to again live in a shared housing environment with other disabled people is one I would simply refuse to take even if it was the only option. It would again just make me feel highly stressed and anxious about my safety as I would be at the mercy of the behaviour of other residence and their mental state. This will strongly impact my emotions and significantly hinder or even stop my ability to complete my academic studies and pursue a career.

---
### Can the Applicant utilise his required Assistive Technology items in a 3 bedroom house? Please provide reasons for your answer
---

I require sufficient space to store my equipment and computer workstation as well as the needed room to manoeuvre unrestricted in my electric power chair. As I'm currently studying and undergoing an internship, I don't want to only be limited to my room in order to be free from noise and distraction. I will not be able to effectively uae my Assistive Technology in a shared housing environment. This section from the ___OT supplementary report dated 18th March 2021 pg 6___ clearly highlights this issue. 

> An Apartment, one resident will ensure that he has access to a work area where he is not distracted by others within the home and not isolated within his bedroom, which would occur in a shared living arrangement. Ignatius remains in his powered wheelchair during the day and therefore accesses his workstation in his wheelchair. A building type of House, 3 residents would not provide sufficient space for the necessary workstation set-up and associated computer access technology.

The ___OT supplementary report dated 18th March 2021 pg 9___ emphasizes the advantage of having the space to allow room for my assistive technology:

> Access to his own living space will ensure he can continue with his studies and seek employment in the future, without disruption or distraction ... and not isolated within his bedroom, which would occur in a shared living arrangement.
